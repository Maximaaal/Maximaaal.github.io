        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p id="aboutText">During my studies, I realised how I could utilise different technologies to convey my concepts in an interactive manner and therefore I gained (a lot) of experience. In the past few years of my education I experimented with technologies such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, electronics (Arduino platforms, circuit design) and creative programming (Python, Javascript, Processing). 
          As a result of the process of discovery and experimentation within the last couple of years, I became more critical towards new technologies; I have explored and researched topics such as internet infrastructures/backbone, cyber-psychology, digital ownership and ethical matters within the field of artificial intelligence such as privacy and artificial wisdom. Inspired by writers such as Marshall McLuhan, Cathy O’Neil, James Bridle and Adam Greenfield I conduct simultaneous research and experimentation — which is the foundation of my work. In which afterwards I seek to visualise and expose systems in the embodiment of a holistic approach in physical and digital form.</p>
