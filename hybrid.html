        In todays western society everyone is able to give its opinion about everything they want. From voting to personal views. That’s how leaderships are chosen (democracy) and also is an important part in our consuming behavior. For example for every restaurant we go to we check the reviews (opinions) of other consumers if we should spend our money there or not. ‘Invisible Planets’ is reflecting this review system based on opinion and trust. By having a crowd sourced system users can review on every planet about their ‘experience’.
On the contrary there is ‘Folding Beijing’, a story set in China. This country is probably the opposite of the freedom of speech we have in the western world. China is a place where a personal view or opinion is not appreciated at times, and censorship has been mandated to maintain control over its populace. This story is visually representing the strong censorship in China today by redacting every form of opinion expressed within this publication.
While reading and interacting with these two publication, you will experience the feeling of freedom of speech and censorship.
